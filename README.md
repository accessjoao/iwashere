Welcome to I Was Here. I created this online scratch map to track my own trips. 

If you want to play with it, simply click on Map or Dark Map, and double-click on the map to add and entry.
After the entry is added, you will see a red flag placed on the map. ðŸš©

After the red flag is placed the database gets updated with the new information. The entry can be deleted by clicking the flag again, and the delete button. ðŸš©

The current log-in page currently has no functionality, and it is intended for a future expansion to allow users to have their own scratch map.

# Get Started

To install the required dependencies run `npm install`.

On the server folder (cd server): `npm run dev` on the terminal to start the server and database.

Open a different terminal and go to the client folder (cd client): `npm start` to start the react-app on your browser.
